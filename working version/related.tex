% \subsection{SAMOA}
\textit{CluStream} has been implemented in different types of software and libraries, being \textit{SAMOA - Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis} one of the options. It is also a distributed computing implementation of the algorithm. The difference is that it is not implemented in \textit{Spark}, but rather in a \textit{Distributed Stream Processing Engine} which adapts the \textit{MapReduce} approach to parallel stream processing\cite{samoa}.

Main differences with this adaptation: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item It does not include an offline macro-clustering phase.
 \item It is developed in \textit{Java} and not designed to work with Spark.
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{StreamDM}
\textit{StreamDM} is a collection of algorithms for mining big data streams \footnote{As it is stated by them here: http://huawei-noah.github.io/streamDM/}. One of the included methods for stream clustering is \textit{CluStream}. This collection of algorithms is developed for Spark.

Main differences with this adaptation: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item It does not include an offline macro-clustering phase.
\end{itemize}
