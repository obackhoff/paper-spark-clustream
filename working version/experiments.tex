\subsection{Experiments setting}
For the experiments we used the Network Intrusion dataset\footnote{Source: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html}, which consists of 494,021 instances. For the analysis, we used only the numerical attributes (\#34 out of \#43 attributes).
We vary the speed of the stream and the horizon and we derive two different stream configurations.
The first one, denoted as $DS1$, has a speed $v=2,0000$ points per timestamp, which implies that it lasts for $\frac{494,021}{2,000} \approx 247$ time units, and a horizon $H=1$. 
The second one, denoted as $DS2$, has a speed of $v=200$ points per timestamp, thus lasting for a period of $\frac{494021}{200} \approx 2470$ time points, and a horizon $H=256$.
To evaluate the clustering quality, we report in Section~\ref{sec:expQuality} on the sum of square distances (SSQ) from the points to their nearest micro-cluster, using Euclidean distance as the distance function, within a horizon $H$. Efficiency and scalability is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:expScalability}.
