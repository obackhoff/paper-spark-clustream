\subsection{Experiments setting}
For the experiments we used the Network Intrusion dataset~\footnote{@Omar: Add a link to the dataset}, which consists of 494,021 instances. For the analysis, we used only the numerical attributes (\#34 out of \#43 attributes).
We vary the speed of the stream and the horizon and we derive two different stream configurations.
The first one, denoted as $DS1$, has a speed $v=2,0000$ points per timestamp and a horizon $H=1$. This implies that the stream lasts for $\frac{494,021}{2,000} \approx 247$ time units. 
The second one, denoted as $DS2$, has a speed of $v=200$ points per timestamp and a horizon $H=256$. Therefore the stream lasts for a period of $\frac{494021}{200} \approx 2470$ time points.

To evaluate the clustering quality, we report in Section~\ref{sec:expQuality} on the sum of squares distance (SSQ) from the points to their nearest micro-cluster, using Euclidean distance as the distance function, within a horizon $H$.

With respect to the efficiency aspect, we report on \color{red}+++\color{black}, in Section~\ref{sec:expScalability}.
